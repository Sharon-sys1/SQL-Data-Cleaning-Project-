# Layoffs Data Cleaning Project (SQL)

This project showcases my SQL skills through a full end-to-end data cleaning process using a dataset of tech company layoffs. The goal was to prepare the raw data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and organising it.

---

## Project Objective

- Clean and standardise a real-world dataset containing tech company layoffs.
- Apply SQL techniques to handle duplicates, missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis and visualisation.

---

## Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- SQL (Standard Query Language)
- [Layoffs.csv](layoffs.csv) dataset

---

## Key Cleaning Tasks

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled null or missing values
- Standardised date formats
- Corrected inconsistent text fields (e.g. company names, locations)
- Converted columns to appropriate data types
- Created new columns for better analysis (e.g. year, quarter, total layoffs)

> All SQL code is available in the script:  
[`Data Cleaning full project Real.sql`](Data%20Cleaning%20full%20project%20Real.sql)
